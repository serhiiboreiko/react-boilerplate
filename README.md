To **build** project just run:

```

or

```
yarn build
```

This will build project with `production` environment.

To change the environment just specify it as a flag
```
yarn build --hotfixes
```

be SURE that you have `.env` file for this environment. (take a look at `.env.hotfixes` or `.env.production` for example)

To **start** project in development mode just run next command:

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

You also can change environment same as above. (`yarn start --hotfixes`)
