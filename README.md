### Usage:

#### Building

To **build** project just run:
```bash
npm run build
```

or

```bash
yarn build
```

This will build project with `production` environment.

To change the environment just specify it as a flag
```bash
yarn build --hotfixes
```

be **SURE** that you have `.env` file for this environment. (take a look at `.env.hotfixes` or `.env.production` for example)

If you want to analyze your build, just run:
```bash
yarn build --analyze
```

#### Starting

To **start** project in development mode just run next command:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

You also can change environment same as above. (`yarn start --hotfixes`)

#### Testing

To run tests just run this:
```bash
yarn test
```

You can always run this with some options like `--watch`. (See jest [docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli))
